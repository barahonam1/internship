Security
============

After extensive research, this was the best method of security I came up with. let me know if any concerns:

Overview
---------
To make sure outsiders do not have access to the files, we will be encrypting the folder names, as well as the filenames.
This will prevent anyone from knowing the location of any specific user or files. Only the user, and the user ONLY, will be able to access their files.
The foldername as well as the filenames will be encrypted with the user's username and password.


Specific
----------

If the users' folder and files do not exist, the encrypted keys will be generated and the files/folders will be created. Otherwise, the files will be read
