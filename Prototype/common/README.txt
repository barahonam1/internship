Important Rules!
----------------

1.	New tabs can be created by copying and pasting each common <tables> child node structure.	
2.	Once the application has at least one user, the current <record> child nodes will become default, unmodifiable nodes.
3.	Changes to the default <record> child nodes could result in potential loss of user data.
4.	The text of nodes such as <tabname>, <title>, <longdesc> are perfectly modifiable.
5.	New <record> child nodes can be created. Once created, these nodes will become new default, unmodifiable nodes.	
6.	The order of the <record> child nodes can be rearranged to administrator's will.

In short, these rules satisfy the requirements of dynamic tabs and dynamic columns for the fron-end table.
